I'm William, a upcycling artist based in Toronto, and I would like to ask your support :)

For my recent 'carp' project, I need a lot, A LOT of flower pots as materials.
Roughly speaking, I'm looking at 50 pcs or more. 

If you could provide me with your used flower pots, it would mean very much to me. 

All pots should be emptied, but there is no need to wash. 
Details like size, color, and pattern does not matter at all!

I usually collaborate with several upcycling artists in Seongsu-dong, Korea. The project I'm working on these days is making chairs with abandoned suit cases. I plan to make several chairs, hold a showcase, and sell them myself.
If you have a suit case that you don't use at home, send it to me and it will be of great help to my work.
